 * client will request the token server to release token .
 * The client offline detection is triggered on the token server.
 * If the offline detection time is exceeded, token server will trigger
 * the detection token clientâ€™s status. If the token client is offline,
 * token server will delete the corresponding tokenId. If it is not offline,
 * token server will continue to save it.
